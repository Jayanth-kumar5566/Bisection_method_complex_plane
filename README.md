* Quad.m - This function quadrasects the given rectangle into 4
congruent rectangles and return them

* bisection.m - This is a function that takes in a line and returns the
 root there is one on the line

* boundary.m - This is a function that takes in vertices of a
 rectangle as input argument and returns the roots on the boundary if
 present.(This function invokes bisection.m)

* cpol.m - This is an example complex valued function. 

=================================================================

* vector_field.m - plots a vector field of the polynomial cpol.

* winding_number.m - Prints the winding number of the function, note 
the function must be specified along with its derivative in a specified 
format, even the points must be of that format

* complex_2_coord.m - Converts complex numbers in Complex plane to R^2
